Coding Mind Seattle has partnered with Coerver NW Coachingâ€”a global leader in youth soccer training for over 40 yearsâ€”to launch a three-month, hands-on coding program where students will directly contribute to the official redesign of Coerver's website.

This isn't just classroom practice. It's coding, design, and teamwork applied to a live project that will be used and seen worldwide.

**Admissions Advantage:** This program offers real-world experience with technology projects from actual companies, enabling students to showcase their hands-on skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities within the context of the latest technological developments.

## Course Offerings

Selected participants will have the opportunity to choose and take part in the following hands-on courses:

â€¢ **Frontend Development** â†’ Build web pages with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and React  
â€¢ **Backend Development** â†’ Create practical modules with JavaScript  
â€¢ **Data Analysis** â†’ Pull and process data to generate reports  

In our project, we will learn and collaborate on GitHub workflows, code review, CI/CD automation, bug tracking, and testing.

## Class Setup

â€¢ **Small group format:** 1 teacher with up to 4 students  
â€¢ **Duration:** 3 months  
â€¢ **Final evaluation:** every student receives feedback; top performers earn awards from Coding Mind & Coerver NW  

Because this is a high-value, fast-paced practical project, we want every student to keep up and gain meaningful results. Therefore, Coding Mind will interview students to ensure participants are well-prepared to fully engage in the real-world project experience.
