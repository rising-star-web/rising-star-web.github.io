bodyText1: "Ken designed and developed an innovative community-based learning app focused on history. The app integrates interactive functions and curated content, enabling students to learn historical knowledge in a more engaging way. Users can complete tasks, participate in discussions, and access resources within the platform, transforming history learning into an enjoyable and collaborative experience. This project not only highlighted Ken’s unique perspective in merging technology with the humanities but also played a key role in his successful admission to Johns Hopkins University (JHU)."
bodyText2: "The History Community App leverages Python and front-end technologies to incorporate features such as knowledge feeds, interactive quizzes, study check-ins, and community discussions. It not only tackles the challenge of making history less monotonous but also enhances motivation and engagement through task-driven learning and social interaction. By balancing practicality and creativity, the project provided students with a new way of learning while demonstrating strong potential in interdisciplinary innovation — ultimately becoming a standout factor in Ken’s JHU acceptance."
