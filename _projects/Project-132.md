bodyText1: "Kaitlyn designed and developed an AI-based application — ToneSense. This app analyzes a user’s skin tone and undertone through photos, providing personalized color-matching suggestions. The project goes beyond simple interface design and front-end development; it also incorporates the training and deployment of deep learning models. By creating a practical tool that connects coding, AI technology, and everyday needs, Kaitlyn demonstrates how to truly apply knowledge to real life."
bodyText2: "This project fully showcases Kaitlyn’s comprehensive skills in front-end development, AI model integration, and user experience design. She repeatedly experimented with data collection and model training to ensure accuracy in detecting tones and undertones, while also balancing usability and creativity in the interface. Beyond the technical breakthroughs, Kaitlyn demonstrated strong abilities in project management, testing optimization, and user experience improvement. The final outcome is not only an app successfully published on Google Pay, but also a shining example of how she combined personal interests with advanced technical skills."
